## Presentation structure questions
- What happened and/or what did I / we do? (with examples)
- What was the result? 
- What is my conclusion?
- What can I recommend / advise?
- What can I / we do next?

## Team exercise: Team member takes charge of x project
Goal: Foster growth in the person

- Next week you are in charge of x
- But I or a, and b etc. will help you by asking the right questions

## Delegation meeting w/ team member
- Intro to task
- Why do I want / need to delegate this?
- Goal of task
- Frame the task and subtasks
  - Set boundaries - what does this not include?
- Set expectations
- Agree on explicit contract
- Set deadline
- Set positive control points
  - Is coaching, not controlling / seeing if failed
  - eg. "lets meet every 2 weeks to see how things are going and if I can help in any way"
  - Appreciate effort even if results are not where we wished
  - These are for course-correcting underway between what we desired, vs what they achieved / where they are going
- Short version:
  - Telling them: What, finished when
  - Asking them: How will you achieve this?

## Principle of success with team member
**Personal level:**
> My success is your success
- Why is it good for me if you succeed?
- Helping, caring
- Take the time, follow up
- Make a commitment and follow through
- Apologise when right thing to do, w/o debasing yourself 

**Company level:**
> Our success is your success
- How does company success benefit them?

**Theory**
- Being succesful means making others succeful
- Find win-win scenarios

## General rule: No "but"'s

## Effective listening
- 5 W-questions before giving own opinion
  - Why, What, Who, How, etc.
- Ask open questions
  - "How will you solve x" instead of "Are you planning to solve x by y"
- Accept that others have different perspectives
- Identify common grounds, not only differences

### Ask 3 questions
Silly example:

- "What is important for you in this room?" (show interest)
- "How do you like your perfect Apfelschorle?" (ask to their preferences)
- "Can I try one the way you like it?" (ask for help / a small gesture which makes them feel good)
  - I have trouble getting it right for my girlfriend (open self up, show weakness in a safe manner, deepen relationship)

## Asking questions 

### Avoiding resistance
- Instead of:
  - Why not? (causes resistance)
- Ask:
  - What would be an alternative? (much easier to move people with)

### 360
Ok. Even if that is optimal, let us explore: What else can we do? (much easier to move people with)


## My leadership action items
- Give honest praise
- Know the motivation of my interactors (team, boss, stakeholders, customers, etc.)
- Ask more open questions
- Practice effective delegation

## Empowering internal dialogue vs self-deprecating
**Victimizing:**
- I cant figure x out
- I exercise too little
- I am not good at relational algebra
- I am not very patient
- I am not allowed to put my feet on the table

**Empowering:**
- I have things I want to learn regarding x (I choose to learn x)
- I want to start exercising more (I choose to ...)
- I did not put effort into relational algebra (I chose not to - it was _my_ choice)
- I often behave less patient ("I currently behave like" instead of "I am just this way" - it is changeable, not victimizing)
- I accept to not put my feet on the table (I have the power to accept or not (and at the extreme, quit). It is my _choice_)

## Giving feedback
- Always be concrete
  - Observations
  - Suggerstions
  - Examples
- Always keep eye contact
  - Makes it personal
  - Not too much; do not make it creepy

### Feedback sandwich
- Something positive (Gives them the energy to move)
- Something to improve (How they should move / towards what)
  - Give **concrete** improvement suggerstions
- Something positive again (Reaffirms bond, reapplies energy to move)

## Manager vs. Leader
- When a manager is talking, you feel like they are the point
- When a leader is talking, you feel that you are the point

## Self-reflection
In terms of leadership:
- What concrete behaviors am I good at?
- Where can I improve? Where do I _want_ to improve?
- What feedback do I get from my peers?
  - Below
  - Same level
  - Above
- How do I want others to see me?
- What are my personal growth targets?
- What can _and do I want to_ do to improve _this week_
  - What can I do today?

## Moving others
- You need to know them to move them
- If you do not know, ask:
  - What can I do to make this more valuable to you?
- Seeing the world from their point of view

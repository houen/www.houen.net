## Background

We are using [Google Hangouts](https://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/) a lot in my workplace. We use it for our nerd discussions, as well as our daily standup meetings. It is a great way for us to collaborate in a meetings without actually having to be in the room together. The one thing that we were lacking was being able to create a permanent Google hangout link, shorten it, and put it in our chat subject bar for easy access. IT turns out there is a very simple trick for doing that.

## Permanent Google Hangout link

Step one: You need a [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) account.

Now for the very easy fix. Simply create a new calendar event, several years in the future. How about 24th of December 2042?

On the Event create popup (Seen below), click “Edit event.”

This will take you to the more advanced event edit section. Here you can attach a Google Hangout. (It is right in the middle where it says “Video Call” – see image below.)

Add the Google+ hangout. Then save the event.

Now click on the new event in your calendar, and click “Join Google Hangout”. Then copy the link from your browser address bar, and you’re done.

This link will work for as long as your calendar event exists in the future. You now have a permanent Google Hangout link that you can share with friends or coworkers. Maybe event you aunt?

You can even use a service like bit.ly to make a nice short link that will fit in the topic bar of Slack.

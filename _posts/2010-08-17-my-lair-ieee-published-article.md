Okay – this will be the last repost of stuff from my old blog:

I had an article “LAIR: Language of Automatically Inferred Redaction” published in the IEEE paper ICSC, and as a result I, together with my project partner Steffen Hedegaard were invited (and went) to speak at the conference in Berkely, San Fransisco. Fun times. Here’s the [article](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z1cr97zhrt8oxdy/lair_article.pdf?dl=0).

And the IEEE article link: [LAIR at IEEE](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSC.2009.79 "LAIR at IEEE")

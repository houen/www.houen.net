  <b>Revisiting my work guide.</b>
  <p>I have been working on a work guide for a while now. That is an understatement. I started it in 2011. Then I left it to sit for many years. I will try to revisit it again now in little bite-sized posts.</p>
  <p>See the <a href="/work-guide">work guide</a> page for all parts.</p>
